# Collaborating

Collaborating on Overleaf is much more doable if you have access to a [paid plan](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans). If you have a collaborator who has a paid plan, then you will have access to the features that are part of their plan. 

## Seeing collaborators

Different users will show up as a square with the first initial of their username if collaborators are also working on the same file.

## Sharing

You can share a project with a collaborator or really the world similarly to a Google document by clicking on the share button and specifying how you want people to access your project.

### Adding comments

You can also write comments about specific text by highlighting the text in review mode (by first pressing the review button) and then clicking "add comment".
