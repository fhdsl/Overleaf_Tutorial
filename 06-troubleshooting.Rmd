# Troubleshooting

Overleaf has lots of ways to make writing in LaTeX easier. In this chapter we will cover several of these ways, as well as how to identify and fix a problem if you encounter one.

## Code Suggestions

As you type code, Overleaf makes code suggestions based on what you have already typed. You can click on a suggestion to use it. Overleaf will also suggestion what to put within command brackets. This can be great if you can't quite remember what a command is or if you are trying to write a document faster.


```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "TOverleaf makes code suggestions based on what you have already typed. You can click the suggestion to autocomplete your code."}
